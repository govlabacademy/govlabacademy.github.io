		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>This group is designed for those focusing on innovation in local lawmaking. Led by New York City Council Member Ben Kallos and supported by the GovLab Academy team, sign up if you want to collaborate to advance projects designed for use by legislators or in connection with legislatures at the local level. These might include projects for constituent engagement, crowdsourced lawmaking, enhanced drafting and archiving of local laws and rules, and other tech-enabled strategies for enhancing legitimacy and effectiveness in municipal legislatures and among local regulators. By bringing together those working on lawmaking at the local level we hope both to help each team advance its own project and, potentially, to discover opportunities for collaborating in the creation of turn-key solutions for the Legislature and legislators. Applicants welcome from private, public and government sectors and should have a concrete project in mind, whether implementing or customizing an existing code base, or building something new, with goal of having a minimum viable product (MVP) ready to change the world.</p>

              <h4>Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the City Council</h4>
              <p>At the beginning of his career in public service, Ben Kallos put Albany voting records online so New Yorkers could hold politicians accountable. Since then, he has run a government reform organization that helped defeat a corrupt politician and has served as Policy Director for former Public Advocate Mark Green. Council Member Kallos serves as Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the City Council, where he has fought to bring reform and transparency to government agencies. Praised by the New York Times for his "fresh ideas," Council Member Kallos has advocated for improving our schools, senior services and transportation. Council Member Kallos graduated from Bronx Science, SUNY Albany and SUNY Buffalo Law School. He has a background in law, working as a union-side labor attorney, as well as technology and government, and has served as a member of Community Board 8 and Statewide Committee Chair for the New York Democratic Lawyers Council. He and his wife reside on the East Side, where he has lived his entire life.</p>
