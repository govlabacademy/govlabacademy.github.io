              <p>At the beginning of his career in public service, Ben Kallos put Albany voting records online so New Yorkers could hold politicians accountable. Since then, he has run a government reform organization that helped defeat a corrupt politician and has served as Policy Director for former Public Advocate Mark Green.

Praised by the New York Times for his "fresh ideas," Council Member Kallos has advocated for improving our schools, senior services and transportation. Council Member Kallos graduated from Bronx Science, SUNY Albany and SUNY Buffalo Law School. He has a background in law, working as a union-side labor attorney, as well as technology and government, and has served as a member of Community Board 8 and Statewide Committee Chair for the New York Democratic Lawyers Council.

              <h4>Coordinator of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre</h4>
              <p>Francois Grey is a physicist by training, with a background in nanotechnology and a passion for citizen science. Since September 2014, he is Invited Professor at the University of Geneva and Manager of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a partnership between CERN, the United Nations Institute of Training and Research and the University of Geneva. 
<br/>
The CCC develops technologies that lower the barrier to entry for online participatory science and promotes the use of these technologies in developing regions through face-to-face meetups between scientists, developers and citizens. The CCC has helped to launch citizen science projects such as CERN’s Test4Theory, which is part of the LHC@home volunteer computing initiative, and open source platforms for citizen science like Crowdcrafting.org, for volunteer thinking. Events launched by the CCC include the Africa@Home, Asia@home and Brasil@home workshops series, the CERN Webfest and the biannual Citizen Cyberscience Summit. 
<br/>
From 2013-2014 Francois was Head of Citizen Science at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, where he launched the Science and the City hackathons in collaboration with ITP, NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program and Science Hack Day NYC in collaboration with the World Science Festival. 
<br/>
Francois was based in Beijing from 2008-2013, where he helped establish the Open Wisdom Lab at Tsinghua University, China’s MIT, to promote concepts of open and participatory science. He also helped establish Tsinghua’s Lifelong Learning Lab, which extends concepts of participatory science to children of all ages. He has also been a visiting Senior International Expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he initiated online citizen science in China through a project called CAS@home. Francois received a prestigious Fellowship from the South-Africa-based Shuttleworth Foundation in 2010-11, for his efforts to promote citizen science in the developing world.

              <p>Liz is an activist and designer interested in collaborative urban environments. My early days in New York involved catalyzing public interactions on sidewalks and subway stations with a giant "Talk To Me" sign as well as working 25 floors above Wall Street (SOM) designing international new cities and campuses. I'm originally from North Carolina where I managed an urban agriculture youth enterprise called the Durham Inner-city Gardeners (DIG). Currently, when I'm not hoisting cameras up on balloons (with Public Laboratory) or hugging trees with tape measures (with TreeKIT), I teach geospatial tools for urban design at Columbia, Parsons, and Pratt.

              <p>Clay Johnson is an American technologist, co-founder and Chairman of the Department of Better Technology and best known for his role in supporting political campaigns and government agencies with technology services. He was one of the founders of Blue State Digital, the firm that built and managed Barack Obama’s online campaign for the presidency in 2008. After leaving Blue State, Johnson was the director of Sunlight Labs at the Sunlight Foundation, where he built an army of 2000 developers and designers to build open source tools to give people greater access to government data. He was awarded the Google/O’Reilly Open Source Organizer of the year in 2009, was one of Federal Computing Week’s Fed 100 in 2010, and won the CampaignTech Innovator award in 2011. Johnson’s combination of experience as a developer, working in politics, entrepreneurism, and non-profit work gives him a unique perspective on media and culture. His life is dedicated to giving people greater access to the truth about what’s going on in their communities, their cities and their governments. He still claims that he learned all he needs to know from a two year tour as the late-shift waiter at Waffle House in Atlanta, GA.</p>

        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">What is an Academy Coaching Program?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">It is a hands-on, issue-focused learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to one or another specific type of public interest problem using civic technology. Geared to the purpose-driven participant who is a member of an active team that is passionate about a public problem and already undertaking a project, this program helps you develop a project from idea to implementation. Unlike a traditional accelerator, we focus only on the public interest and only on projects that work with real-world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="b-faq-item">
          <p class="e-question">How Does it Work?</p>
          <p class="e-answer">The coaching programs are  limited enrollment (maximum class size of 10 projects), entirely online, highly customized, and meet every week for 4 consecutive weeks or every other week for 8 weeks. To help you and your team become more effective, we offer a combination of coaching and skill-building, connection to a network of subject-matter experts, peer-to-peer mentoring, customized and original learning materials, and frequent and constructive feedback opportunities from a team of teachers and peers at every stage of your agile design-driven process.</p>
          <p>All GovLab Academy’s coaching programs offer a “flipped” learning experience. There are no experts at the front of the room or the top of the screen delivering packaged content to passive learners. You are at the center of everything we do – a civic entrepreneur working on real projects in real communities. Around you we organize the relevant materials, mentor and coaching networks, training exercises, and practice sessions.</p>

          <ul class="e-answer">
            <li>Upon admission, faculty and staff will engage with your team to identify opportunities, diagnose problems, and develop a customized reading and research plan.</li>
            <li>Each week, the full group meets online with the faculty for 1-2 hours where one hour is discussion of projects by the group and the second hour is a guest lecture.</li>
            <li>Each week, participants meet on their own in smaller groups.</li>

          <p class="e-question">Who May Participate?*</p>
          <div class="e-answer">
            <p>Innovators working inside, outside, or in collaboration with public institutions. We will give strong preference to team, as opposed to individual, applications -- especially teams based in US cities</p>
            <p>And you have:</p>
            <ul class="b-list">
              <li>A problem about which you are passionate.</li>
              <li>An open mind to developing innovative approaches that take advantage of technology to bring the broader palette of human expertise to bear on your problem.</li>
              <li>Intellectual curiosity and a willingness to experiment are essential for this course. No formal technology training is assumed or required, but a willingness to play with new tools will be.</li>
              <li>Time and energy to commit to the program activities.</li>
              <li>The drive to do what it takes to develop a project from idea to implementation with the potential of real-world impact for people and communities. Keep in mind that the way to have the greatest impact might not involve building an app or creating a new non-profit but collaborating with others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>* Further pre-requisites may apply on specific courses</p>
