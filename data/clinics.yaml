- name: "Decision Analysis and Risk Management"
  partner: the University of Eastern Finland
  date: March - May 2015 # Date can be in two formats ie. "January 2015" or "By Request"
  duration: 
  description_short: >
    The aim of the course is to expose participants to the fundamentals of decision analysis, the connections between assessments and societal decision making, and the role of decision making in a pragmatic context of improving outcomes. Participants will learn to apply the scientific method and falsification in the context of an assessment, and know how to build an open assessment based on the requirements of societal decision making. The focus is on how to convincingly exclude poor decision options rather than trying to find a theoretically optimal solution (e.g. with highest expected utility).

  partner: The World Bank

  duration: 
  description_short: >
   Governments are more effective when they work with citizens to solve problems 
   and development challenges. For this reason, the World Bank, in partnership
   with the London School of Economics, The Overseas Development Institute, 
   Participedia, and CIVICUS, has developed a free 4-week course on Citizen 
   Engagement, hosted by Coursera.
   <br/>
   The course provides a holistic overview of citizen engagement through 
   interactive videos, resources, and activities and is taught by a number of the
   foremost experts in the field, including John Gaventa (IDS, Coady Institute),
   Rakesh Rajani (Ford Foundation), Danny Sriskandarajah (CIVICUS), Jonathan 
   Fox (American University), and Beth Simone Noveck (The Governance Lab). 
   It examines the role citizen engagement can play in improving policymaking 
   and pubic service delivery, and investigates the impact of new technologies,
   particularly in developing countries. Participants can contribute their own
    insights and connect with others through online forums, dedicated social
    media channels, and Google hangouts.
