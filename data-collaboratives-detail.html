		<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>Over the past years, corporate efforts in which private data is shared with research teams have shown the potential that private sector data holds to drive social change. This program is designed for those seeking for insights about corporate data sharing to private sector participants. Through it we will explore your datasets potential to promote social good; what risks might occur when their corporate datasets are shared, and how to mitigate those risks; and, the different models for sharing (shades of open, different data governance models, etc). The term ‘Data Collaborative’ was coined by the NYU GovLab, to describe a new kind of corporate data sharing effort, where data is not blind-sightedly opened to the public, but rather shared with specific parties in a controlled environment. Corporations engaging in a Data Collaborative keep a certain amount of control over the data they make available to, for example, research teams. This practice offers a safe way of providing the research community with oftentimes highly valuable data, whilst mitigating the risks involved. In particular, this course will cover the following subjects: a) develop an understanding of what corporate data sharing is and why corporations engage in it; b) learn what current corporate data sharing efforts look like (through i.a. the GovLab Data Collaboratives Directory), which types of corporate data sets are currently being shared, and who are using them; c) learn from others through understanding how research teams are using corporate data sets to create solutions, and to optimize their operations, through in-depth case studies and analyses; d) provide strategies for small organization to define a strategy for sharing some of their data assets, take stock of in-house data resources available to them, and experiment with data sharing in a safe space; and e) Understand the challenges and best practices of corporate data sharing.</p>

Verhulst is Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer of the Governance Laboratory @NYU (GovLab) where he is responsible for building a research foundation on how to transform governance using advances in science and technology. Verhulst’s latest scholarship centers on how technology can improve people’s lives and the creation of more effective and collaborative forms of governance. Specifically, he is interested in the perils and promise of collaborative technologies and how to harness the unprecedented volume of information to advance the public good. Before joining NYU full time, Verhulst spent more than a decade as Chief of Research for the Markle Foundation, where he continues to serve as Senior Advisor. At Markle, an operational foundation based in New York, he was responsible for overseeing strategic research on all the priority areas of the Foundation including, for instance: transforming health care using information and technology, re-engineering government to respond to new national security threats, improving people’s lives in developing countries by connecting them to information networks, developing multi-stakeholder networks to tackle global governance challenges, changing education through information technology et al. Many of Markle’s reports have been translated into legislation and executive orders, and have informed the creation of new organizations and businesses. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Culture and Communications at New York University, Senior Research Fellow for the Center for Media and Communications Studies at Central European University in Budapest; and an Affiliated Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Global Communications Studies at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communications.

He is still an emeritus fellow at Oxford. He also taught several years at the London School of Economics. Verhulst was the UNESCO Chairholder in Communications Law and Policy for the UK, a former lecturer on Communications Law and Policy issues in Belgium, and Founder and Co-Director of the International Media and Info-Comms Policy and Law Studies at the University of Glasgow School of Law. He has served as a consultant to numerous international and national organizations, including the Council of Europe, the European Commission, UNESCO, World Bank, UNDP, USAID, the UK Department for International Development among others. He has been a grant recipient of the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Markle Foundation. Verhulst has authored and co-authored several books, including: In Search of the Self: Conceptual Approaches to Internet Self Regulation (Routledge, 2001); Convergence in European Communications Regulation (Blackstone, 1999); EC Media Law and Policy (AWL, 1998); Legal Responses to the Changing Media (OUP, 1998); and Broadcasting Reform in India (OUP, 1998). Most recently, he co-edited The Routledge Handbook of Media Law (2013).
